          <h3>Photography</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a Hobby-Photographer since pretty much 10 years. I started taking fotos of landscapes like mountains or seas but I turned from that
            pretty fast. By now I love to take shots of animals and humans as well as unusual perspectives of "boring" stuff like cups, figures and flowers
            (no judgement here please).

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>
            I started programming back in school with "Pascal". As soon as I started to study at the University of Rostock I've expanded my love for
            programming. For pretty much 3 or 4 years I only used "C++" since this was the primary language to programm with. By now I haven't touched
            C++ about 5 years since I'm only using Java and everything around Web Development like HTML, CSS and JS. In addition I've made some experience
            with Python and SQL and am extending my SQL-Skills like right now.
